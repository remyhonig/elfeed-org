;;; Commentary:
;; Maintaining tags for all rss feeds is cumbersome using the regular
;; flat list where there is no hierarchy and tag names are duplicated
;; a lot.  Org-mode makes the book keeping of tags and feeds much
;; easier.  Tags get inherited from parent headlines.  Multiple files
;; can be specified to separate your private from your work feeds for
;; example.  You may also use tagging rules to tag feeds by entry-title
;; keywords.  See https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org for usage.
